# Level up!

Level up is a React-based web app that allows users to build branching "leveling trees" for personal use. Think Skyrim's leveling system, but for anything you want.

## To-dos

The simplest version of this app will be leveling in a line - that is, without any branches. Achieving 'A' will unlock 'B', and so on.

```
A -> B -> C
```
